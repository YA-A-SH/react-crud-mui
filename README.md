YA-SOURCE 🚀 | Student Management System
YA-SOURCE is one of my first standalone React projects, built entirely from scratch—from the initial concept to execution. This project marks a significant milestone in my journey as a Frontend Developer.

📅 Project Timeline
Start Date: September 2025.

Duration: Completed in just 3 days of intensive learning and coding.

Purpose: To document my progress and demonstrate my ability to build a full CRUD application under a tight deadline.

🛠 Tech Stack
React.js: Core framework for UI and state management.

Material UI (MUI): Used for layout and components (my first time exploring this library).

LocalStorage: Persistent data storage to keep student records safe after page refreshes.

CSS3: Custom styling and keyframe animations for the background and specific UI tweaks.

✨ Key Features
Full CRUD Functionality: Create, Read, Update, and Delete student records.

Smart Data Validation: Strict rules for inputs (e.g., age limits, email formatting, and phone number length) to ensure data integrity.

A Very Simple Dark/Light Mode: A custom-styled toggle switch using MUI's ThemeProvider.

Advanced Sorting: Ability to sort the student table by Name, ID, Age, or Progress percentage.

Interactive UI: Real-time feedback via success alerts and hover effects.

💡 Lessons Learned & Reflection
This project was a "technical battlefield" for me, and here is what I gained:

The MUI Learning Curve: Initially, I struggled with MUI’s styling system, which is why you will see a separate CSS file. I used it to bridge the gap between my vision and my technical knowledge at the time.

Input Logic Complexity: The most challenging part was building the validation logic for inputs. I focused heavily on ensuring users enter realistic data rather than random strings.

Growth Mindset: While the code is simple compared to my current standards, I chose to keep it in its original state. It serves as a "living proof" of how much I evolve with every new project.
